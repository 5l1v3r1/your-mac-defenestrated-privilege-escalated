All you cool kids that "only know" Python and refuse to learn Applescript, Objective-C, Swift, or Cocoa basics don't have to feel left out! Far better than just a handful of sample PoCs, Greg Neale of Disney Animation Studios gave a fantastic talk at Penn State Mac Admins 2017 called "Turbocharge your scripting with PyObjC" that goes into detail on leveraging the PythonObj-C bridge so that you can make the your own payloads.

Apple is generous and provides this same bridge for Python, Ruby, Javascript, and more so there is no excuse not to help contribute some interesting modules to the community so we can all see something besides the same old same old.
